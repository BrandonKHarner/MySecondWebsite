                <dd><p>This is a website I'm making for an assignment in a computer programming class.</p></dd>
                <dd><p>This is also the 2nd website I'm ever making in HTML... so cut me some slack if it doesn't look the greatest.</p></dd>
                <dd><p>Unfortunatley, This website currently doesn't have a CSS or JavaScript file so it's pretty plain. Idealy there will be colors, tabs, the two links at the top will become buttons, etc.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>My name is Brandon Harner, and I am a 3rd year in Computer Programming at CPACTC (at the time of the creation of this website.)</p></dd>
                <dd><p>Currently the 2nd and 3rd years are doing Website Design (which will rotate to Data Structure next year after I graduate) and this is the first website assignment</p></dd>
